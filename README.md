# LeetCode Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems written in Go. Each solution is contained in its own file named after the problem title in kebab case.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

```
leetcode.git
    add-binary.go
    binary-tree-inorder-traversal.go
    maximum-depth-of-binary-tree.go
    ...
```

Each file in the repository represents a different LeetCode problem. The file name is based on the URL of the problem, converted to kebab case and with a `.go` extension. Within each file, you'll find the solution code and any necessary comments to explain the thought process behind the solution.
